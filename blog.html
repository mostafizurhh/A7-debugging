            <h3>Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage?</h3><br>
            <p><b>Answer:</b></p><br>
            <p>'localStorage' and 'sessionStorage' are almost identical and have the same API. The difference is that
                with sessionStorage, the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. With localStorage,
                the data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your web app clears the
                data. </p><br>

            <h3>What is the difference between Global Scope and Block Scope?</h3> <br>
            <p><b>Global Scope:</b></p> <br>
            <p> Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. If you assign a value to a
                variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable. Global variables
                can be accessed
                from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when
                declared outside a block.</p> <br><br>
            <p><b>Block Scope:</b></p> <br>
            <p>'let' & 'const' these two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a { }
                block cannot be accessed from outside the block and has block scope.

            <h3>How does event loop work in JavaScript?</h3><br>
            <p><b>Answer:</b></p> <br>
            <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the codes in a
                stack of frame,
                collecting and processing events as object in a heap, and executing queued sub-tasks.</p> <br>

            <h3>How many ways you may get 'Undefined' from a code?</h3><br>
            <p><b>Answer:</b></p>
            <p>
                There are 8 different possible ways we may get 'Undefined' from any code. <br> <br>
                1. Variable that is not initialized or assigned any value. <br>
                2. Function that has no 'return'. <br>
                3. If a function has parameters but we didn't pass one or more parameters when calling that function,
                will give undefined. <br>
                4. In a function if 'return' has nothing on right side. <br>
                5. Property/Key that doesn't exists on an object. <br>
                6. Accessing array element outside of the index range. <br>
                7. Deleting an element inside an array. <br>
                8. Set a value directly to 'Undefined'.
